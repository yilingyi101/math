**Problem B**: Attachment 4 has it as Caribbean Medical Center, Jajardo which is a typo it should be Caribbean Medical Center, Fajardo

**Problem C**: Additional variables derived from the data provided is acceptable. Map data (coordinates, distances, adjacency of counties and states) is acceptable from outside sources. Additional explanatory or response variables from other sources are not acceptable.

Tennessee data: The data set was altered to include Pennsylvania to replace Tennessee. Use the Pennsylvania data.

**Problem E**: We are aware that the two internet links to data sets in problem E are unavailable because of US government shut down. These were only optional resources and were not necessary for modeling this problem. Teams are still welcome to find their own appropriate data sets, if needed for their solution.
